## `[37]` CT.gov Publication Undercount Audit

**Type:** methods  |  ESTIMAND: Weighted PubMed NCT-match rate among older CT.gov records lacking linked publications  
**Data:** Sponsor-class-stratified sample of 1,050 older no-link studies queried against PubMed by NCT ID

### 156-word body

How often do ClinicalTrials.gov records with no linked publication hide an external PubMed trail when searched by NCT identifier? We drew a sponsor-class-stratified audit sample of 1,050 older studies lacking CT.gov publication links from the March 29, 2026 full-registry snapshot. Each sampled NCT identifier was queried against PubMed using identifier-based E-utilities searches, then reweighted back to the sponsor-class distribution of older no-link studies. The weighted PubMed NCT-match rate across the no-link older-study population was only 1.2 percent, indicating that external publication rescue was uncommon on this identifier-based audit. The weighted external-publication-only rate among no-link studies was just 0.3 percent, and the industry sample reached 2.0 percent on the raw PubMed match rate. Missing CT.gov publication links therefore look more like true visible sparsity than widespread under-linking, at least under a strict NCT-indexed external search strategy. This audit is sample-based and identifier-dependent, so it can miss publications that omit NCT identifiers or sit outside PubMed indexing today.

Data availability: No patient-level data used. Analysis derived exclusively
  from publicly available aggregate records. All source identifiers are in
  the protocol document linked above.

Ethics: Not required. Study uses only publicly available aggregate data; no
  human participants; no patient-identifiable information; no individual-
  participant data. No institutional review board approval sought or required
  under standard research-ethics guidelines for secondary methodological
  research on published literature.

Funding: None.

Competing interests: MA serves on the editorial board of Synthēsis (the
  target journal); MA had no role in editorial decisions on this
  manuscript, which was handled by an independent editor of the journal.

AI disclosure: Computational tooling (including AI-assisted coding via
  Claude Code [Anthropic]) was used to develop analysis scripts and assist
  with data extraction. The final manuscript was human-written, reviewed,
  and approved by the author; the submitted text is not AI-generated. All
  quantitative claims were verified against source data; cross-validation
  was performed where applicable. The author retains full responsibility for
  the final content.

Preprint: Not preprinted.

Reporting checklist: PRISMA 2020 (methods-paper variant — reports on review corpus).

Target journal: ◆ Synthēsis (https://www.synthesis-medicine.org/index.php/journal)
  Section: Methods Note — submit the 156-word E156 body verbatim as the main text.
  The journal caps main text at ≤400 words; E156's 156-word, 7-sentence
  contract sits well inside that ceiling. Do NOT pad to 400 — the
  micro-paper length is the point of the format.
